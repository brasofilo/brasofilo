# stack.favs
Pulls (one or more) user's favorite questions on any given Stack Exchange site

##Outdated info
The files https://github.com/brasofilo/stack.favs/blob/gh-pages/js/sites.js and https://github.com/brasofilo/stack.favs/blob/gh-pages/js/sites.min.js are hardcoded and pulled from a direct query on Stack Exchange developer page.
Recent changes on design made the favicon addresses obsolete, meaning, they're borken.
